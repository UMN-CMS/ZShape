# Working Point 80 for 7 TeV Data with Pileup Correction

## Cut Based ID

The following cuts are used for Working Point 80:

| Cut Variable                                              | Value for EB (EE) | Obejct Value Required to be < or > |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Sigma_iEta_iEta                                           | 0.01 (0.031)      | Less Than                          |
| Abs(Delta Phi_in)                                         | 0.027 (0.021)     | Less Than                          |
| Abs(Delta Eta_in)                                         | 0.005 (0.006)     | Less Than                          |
| (isoTK + ecalIso + hcalIso - rhoCorrection) / electron pt | 0.040 (0.033)     | Less Than                          |
| Track Hits                                                | 0 (0)             | Greater Than                       |
| Conversion Distance                                       | 0.02 (0.02)       | Less Than                          |
| Conversion Dcot                                           | 0.02 (0.02)       | Less Than                          |

Where Conversion Dcot is the "difference of cot(angle) with the conversion
partner track".

### Pileup Correction: Rho Correction

We use a Rho Correction using the kt6PFJets. The correction constant is:

rho * pi * 0.3^2

This number is subtracted from the isolation sums before division by the
electron pt.
